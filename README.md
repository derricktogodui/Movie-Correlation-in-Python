# Movie Correlation in Python

### Using a movie dataset I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies), I decided to investigate whether there is a correlation between a movie's budget and its gross earnings using a movie dataset I found on Kaggle. Additionally, I aim to explore if there is a correlation between the movie's production company and its gross earnings.

## Key Finding
* Votes and budget have high correlation to gross earnings
* Company has low correlation
